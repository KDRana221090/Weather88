MVVM design pattern will be used to structure the code into different layers, allowing us to have testability in our codebase, separation of concern, and decouple the layer from each other.


Model: Hold the App data <br/>
View: UI Part/Presentation layer of the App <br/>
ViewModel: Intermediator be View and Model, This layer will contain the actual business logic code.<br/>
